# Accomplishments

The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) program office achieved much in its first year and continues to progress today. See below a snapshot of notable accomplishments.

* Established the FEHRM, finalized its charter and selected permanent leadership—while operationalizing the FEHRM’s mission to deliver common capabilities that enhance health care and enable the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) to implement a single, common federal EHR
* Led value-added activities for DOD, VA and USCG EHR deployments. For example, executed the Enterprise Operations Center (EOC) during recent deployments to provide actionable executive-level insight into information technology production events.
* Launched and expanded the joint health information exchange (HIE), connecting DOD, VA and USCG providers with more than 61,000 external provider sites, allowing clinicians to quickly and securely access patient electronic health information, enhancing clinical decision-making. By the end of the year, we are set to share data with more than 90 percent of community hospitals.
* Published the DOD/VA Interoperability Modernization Strategy, providing a framework for the Departments’ approach to interoperability initiatives, improving how medical data is exchanged and used, and created the Supporting Plan, which compiles DOD and VA initiatives that support the strategy objectives.
* Oversaw shared system configuration and management of the federal EHR through joint decision-making governance bodies.
* Identified and championed joint opportunities to deliver telehealth solutions to meet operational requirements driven by COVID-19.
* Built a path forward for joint sharing sites by categorizing sites by level of integration and impact of the new EHR deployment to their operations and completing site engagements that provide critical information in preparation for joint deployments.
* Went live with a new interface between the Joint Longitudinal Viewer and the Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record in March 2021, enabling the exchange of exposure data as part of the EHR.
* Developed Deployment Map Dashboards to show DOD, VA and USCG deployment data in real time.
* Hosted FEHRM DOD/VA Industry Interoperability Roundtables in November 2020 and May 2021 to discuss the federal EHR and industry approaches for integrating social determinants of health into health care and the FEHRM Town Hall with federal agencies in February 2021 to discuss the role of predictive analytics in assessing and improving community health and wellness.
* Completed the ballot reconciliation for the HL7 Dental Data Exchange project, establishing the technical foundation for sharing computable dental data with private sector dental providers.
* Deployed a range of technical updates to optimize the EHR.  
* Created an onboarding process for new agencies to join the common EHR enterprise;
* Expanded the Risk, Issue and Opportunity Process to include FEHRM, DOD, VA and USCG lessons learned with EHR implementation to inform continuous improvement
