# Federal EHR Success Stories

As of April 2021, there are more than 42,000 federal EHR users (doctors, nurses, etc.) at 42 Military Medical Treatment Facility Commands, two VA sites and four USCG sites across 16 states.

**Standardizing Care**

The federal EHR enables more standard workflows and standard practices to support enhanced clinical decision-making. For example, DOD and VA’s joint data management and analysis efforts led to the ability to improve the process for prescribing opioids. Patients at risk of an opioid overdose who receive opioid pain medication will also receive a life-saving drug that counteracts the opioid prescribed along with education.

**Saving Time**

Providers are reporting they are spending less time on documentation, and more time on direct patient care and interaction. This is invaluable.

**Enhancing Patient Safety**

The federal EHR also enhances patient safety. Barcoding and medicine reconciliation features substantially reduce inpatient medication harm events while automatic alerts notify providers of potential harm when administering medications containing opioids.

**Responding to the Pandemic**

COVID-19 recently demonstrated the success and critical need of a federal EHR. The federal EHR has quickly adapted to the changing demands on the system and supported providers during the pandemic. It is far more adaptable and configurable than legacy systems. For example, the FEHRM, along with DOD, implemented COVID-specific configuration changes in the federal EHR within four hours. The same changes in legacy systems took nearly four weeks to implement.

During the pandemic, the FEHRM, along with DOD, developed a mass vaccination process to assess the status of Service member vaccinations in order to ensure readiness—the ability to deploy. The process was so successful that Cerner adopted it, making the solution part of its baseline product. It’s now available to all of their commercial customers. The FEHRM and DOD is now looking at how to modify the mass vaccination process to do mass lab testing.

The FEHRM and DOD also integrated an Immunization Forecaster into the EHR to help pediatricians know when patients need the next round of appropriate vaccines. These efforts and more are especially timely to facilitate COVID-19 vaccinations.
