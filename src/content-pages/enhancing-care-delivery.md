# Enhancing Care Delivery

 *“As a provider, I am looking forward to using a modern EHR that enables better clinical information support tools and better ways for providers to view information, including standard size order sets, and allowing for more intuitive ways to document patient care.”*

\- Chief Medical Informatics Officer for DHMSM and American Academy of Pediatrics Fellow

An electronic health record (EHR) is software that's used to securely document, store, retrieve, share and analyze information about individual patient care. It enables a digital version of your health record. The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) program office, along with other federal agencies, is implementing a single, common federal EHR to enhance patient care and provider effectiveness.

A federal EHR means as a provider, you will be able to access patient information entered into the EHR from different doctors, pharmacies, labs and other points of care throughout your patient’s care. There is recognition across the board that the federal EHR saves providers time and enables more standard workflows to support enhanced clinical decision-making and patient safety.

This means you benefit from:

* Less times your patients have to repeat their health history, undergo duplicative rests and manage printed health records.
* Access to patient data such as service treatment records, Service medals and honors, housing status and other information to ensure patients receive all their earned benefits  as they transition to civilian life in a seamless, timely fashion.
* Conversations with your patients start more productively since you already have a more comprehensive picture of their health before their appointments.
* You are able to make more informed decisions about your patient’s care as you have access to more relevant data.
* A more seamless care experience. Regardless of whether your patient gets care from DOD, VA, USCG or another health care system participating in the joint health information exchange (HIE), you will be able to easily exchange and access their health information to enhance their quality of care and satisfaction.
