# Defense Health Information Technology Symposium Sessions

The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office presented and exhibited at the 2024 Defense Health Information Technology Symposium (DHITS) from August 20 to 22 in Dallas, Texas.

## Presentations

### Plenary – The Federal EHR: What’s Next

**Thursday, August 22, 2 to 3 p.m. | Landmark Ballroom, Hyatt Regency Dallas**

_Mr. Bill Tinston, FEHRM Director; Dr. Yvette Weber, Program Executive Officer, Program Executive Office, Defense Healthcare Management Systems, Department of Defense (DOD); and Dr. Neil Evans, Acting Program Executive Director, Electronic Health Record Modernization Integration Office, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA); and Ms. Cori Hughes (moderator), FEHRM Program Integration Director_

The Federal Electronic Health Record (EHR) is deployed to all DOD health care sites and the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (Lovell FHCC)─the most complex joint sharing site involving DOD and VA. So, what’s next? The FEHRM works with DOD, VA, the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Coast Guard, and Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to continue deploying the single, common Federal EHR across federal health care sites. This effort enhances patient care and provider effectiveness, wherever care is provided. This session’s panel of FEHRM, DOD, and VA leaders talked about this federal journey toward EHR modernization, including how the federal sector drives change across the health care enterprise, the importance of interoperability, and how the Federal EHR enhances the health care experience of providers and patients across the country.

### Breakout Session – Interface Development within the MHS Information Portal

**Tuesday, August 20, 3:15 to 4:15 p.m. | Reunion BC, Hyatt Regency Dallas**

_Mr. John Dempsey, FEHRM Partner Integration Director_

During this session, Mr. Dempsey and DOD leaders defined several Military Health System Information Platform (MIP) application programming interfaces (APIs) in use and why they are mapped to the Common Data Model, elaborated on how the MIP APIs change the way the MIP serves data, explained the historical background of the API development effort, elaborated on the importance of Common Data Model normalized datasets to the MIP API strategy, and discussed the direction of MIP health surveillance and what is to come.

### Breakout Session – Remove Barriers, Build One Truth: Unified Incident Reporting

**Wednesday, August 21, 12:30 to 1:30 p.m. | Reunion BC, Hyatt Regency Dallas**

_Mr. Lance Scott, FEHRM Chief Technology Officer; Dr. Valerie Seabaugh, FEHRM Acting Deputy Chief Health Informatics Officer; and Ms. Kim Hranowsky (moderator), FEHRM Deputy Chief Technology Officer_

As DOD and VA move onto a single Federal EHR, cross-departmental communication becomes essential. This session opened with the challenges to how incidents are tracked, triaged, and communicated (e.g., service interruptions at Lovell FHCC); discussed the current support measures put into place (e.g., code upgrades, cloud hosting); and closed with the desired future end state to create a single record of truth for system performance.

### Breakout Session – Federal EHR Advancements in Population Health

**Wednesday, August 21, 2 to 3 p.m. | Reunion A, Hyatt Regency Dallas**

_Ms. Crystal Baum, FEHRM Data Exchange Director_ 

In this session, Ms. Baum discussed federal Departments' activities in advancing population health management using the HealtheIntent platform. She highlighted Registries and its ability to identify gaps in patient care and how Health Analytics provides aggregation of data to offer different levels of reporting. She also explained in further detail how Health Record provides a complete view of the longitudinal record.

## Other FEHRM Activities

Attendees witnessed the complete patient journey through the Federal EHR at the **PEO DHMS/FEHRM Booth #509** in the Exhibit Hall in the Marsalis Ballroom. Also, they visited the **FEHRM Kiosk #3** in the MHS Pavilion DHITS Booth in the Exhibit Hall to register and share feedback for the FEHRM’s [Federal EHR Annual Summit](https://www.fehrm.gov/federal-ehr-annual-summit/).

***New in 2024!*** The FEHRM had an onsite videographer to record videos of leaders, end users, Service members, and Veterans sharing why the Federal EHR matters and what it means to them.
