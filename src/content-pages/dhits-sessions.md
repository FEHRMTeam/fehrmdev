We are presenting and showcasing at the 2022 Defense Health Information Technology Symposium (DHITS). Come see us! [Register for the 2022 DHITS on their website.](https://web.cvent.com/event/87e381cd-9ded-471b-b9d2-af8b44d1d361/summary)

## Presentations

### Plenary – Transforming Health Care Delivery Together

*Bill Tinston, Holly Joers and Dr. Leslie Sofocleous*

The FEHRM is leading the DOD, VA and U.S. Coast Guard in implementing a single, common federal EHR that enhances patient care and provider effectiveness, wherever care is provided. A panel of FEHRM, DOD, VA and USCG leaders will talk about this federal journey toward EHR modernization including getting to convergence on shared EHR configurations; implementing joint data and security standards; and driving other joint federal solutions.

### Plenary – Mr. John Windom

*John Windom and Cori Hughes*

An interview with a DOD and VA beneficiary and leader who can speak to the firsthand benefits of a single, common federal EHR.

### Unified Patient Experience: A Technical Perspective

*Brian F Bertrand and Lance Scott*

Discuss the patient portal of unified patient experience from the perspective of the federal EHR. Address technical options and controls to satisfy those requirements, and ensure a positive, secure patient experience when accessing their health.

### Federal EHR - Cybersecurity and the Way Ahead

*Rogelio Raymond and Jeffrey Eyink*

Discuss how the FEHRM, DOD, VA and USCG are mitigating risk to the federal EHR through layers of cybersecurity protections in the Federal Enclave, across the networks, at the sites and with pre-conditions for access to the EHR.

### Environmental and Occupational Exposures: Using Data to Understand their Clinical Effects

*Dr. Norman Stone, Steven Jones, Dr. John Barrett and Devon Matthew*

Developing electronic exposure-related reports has been challenging due to disparate information systems, paper records and electronic records. With advances in technology and access to data, ILER compiles, distills and presents relevant exposure data specific to an individual based on location, date and time. This session will demonstrate how ILER can inform clinical decision-making and advance research for individuals with toxic exposures.

### Integrated Data Management

*Dr. Meredith Josephs, Dr. James Ellzy, Dr. David Alt and Andy Anderson*

Managing data is recognized as central to the success of any organization. This is especially true in the health care sector given the volume and sensitive nature of health data. The FEHRM, in collaboration with DOD and VA, recognize the value of data and strive to leverage that value. This session will provide a high-level view of the relationship between the Departments and how data is managed as a strategic asset in the Federal Enclave.

### Bringing Health Data from the Frontline

*Dr. Meredith Josephs, David Norley and Chris Nichols*

This joint panel will focus on EIDS, FEHRM and JOMIS collaborative efforts highlighting health data convergence forward for operational medicine practitioners. With JOMIS modernizations, EIDS MHS Information Platform and Operational Medicine Data Service data availability, PEO DHMS will better deliver health care data to the Warfighters.

### HealtheIntent: Strategy for Greater EHR Data Integration

*John Dempsey, Dr. James Ellzy, LtCol Peter Easter and Lance Scott*

Take a look at DHA's strategy for expanding Enterprise Clinical Registries via HealtheIntent (HeI) to derive meaningful clinical relationships and improve outcomes. We will discuss the active clinical registries, current plans to consolidate within MHS GENESIS, future state clinician workflows and prioritization of new Enterprise Registries investments. Our HeI focus is how research, cross domain condition commonalities and scoring will catalyze change.

### Interoperability: A Global Perspective

*Lance Scott, Chris Nichols and Crystal Baum*

A panel of FEHRM and DOD leaders will discuss the vision for data sharing between the federal health care system and community partners. They will provide an update on achieving and independently assessing interoperability across this ecosystem including expanding joint HIE; reporting immunization data; and enhancing patient and population health management through HealtheRegistries, natural language processing and large scale bio-surveillance.

## FEHRM Booth

The FEHRM will also have a booth displaying handouts and showcasing the joint health information exchange and HealtheRegistries.
