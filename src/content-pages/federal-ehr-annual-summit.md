# Federal EHR Annual Summit

Each year, the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization office brings together clinical staff from the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), community providers and other leading clinical experts to assess the use of the federal electronic health record (EHR). The discussions focus on opportunities for enhancing the federal EHR to better serve our Service members, Veterans and other beneficiaries. Participants hear from federal leaders and experts, earn continuing medical education credits, network with peers and share their experiences to enhance patient care.

This year’s summit is scheduled virtually from Tuesday, October 25, to Thursday, October 27, 2022. Note: The summit is intended for clinical staff at DOD, VA and USCG sites that have used the federal EHR for four months or more.
