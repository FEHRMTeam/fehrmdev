# HL7 Government Birds of a Feather

The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office hosts Health Level Seven® International (HL7®) Government Birds of a Feather meetings in conjunction with HL7 Working Group Meetings that take place three times annually. HL7 Government Birds of Feather is a forum platform for federal partners, industry and interoperability standards experts to present, share and discuss cutting-edge and current trends in interoperability and electronic health record modernization.

The last HL7 Government Birds of the Feather meeting in September 2022 featured an overview of the FEHRM charter, mission, role and capabilities. It also included a presentation titled "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Social Determinants of Health Data Exchange for Chronic Disease Prevention Initiative." During the meeting, federal and industry partners facilitated, promoted and collaborated on interoperability.
