# HL7 Government Birds of a Feather

The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office hosts the only Government Health Level Seven International (HL7) affinity group meeting (“Birds of a Feather”) in conjunction with HL7 Working Group meetings that take place three times annually. This is the only open forum that brings together government and industry members to discuss standards, exchange ideas on interoperability, and enhance collaboration across government departments and agencies.

This event is considered the voice of the public sector at HL7, connecting interoperability experts and health information technology consumers from the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Commerce to promote trends and cutting-edge digital interoperability standardization for adoption. It provides the opportunity to promote and influence Interoperability policies and best practices among policymakers, the standards community, electronic health care vendors, and health care providers, per National Defense Authorization Act 2020 mandates.

**The next HL7 Government Birds of a Feather Meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, May 14, 9 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. ET.**
