# Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) Office Industry Roundtable

May 18, 2022\
8:30 AM – 12:30 PM ET (Virtual)

On May 18, 2022, the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office will host the 12th FEHRM Industry Roundtable.  Twice a year, the FEHRM hosts a government and industry roundtable to discuss the current and future state of health information technology and health information exchange.  The roundtable also highlights the importance of the FEHRM, Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) collaborating with external partners to ensure the single, common federal electronic health record (EHR) serves the unique needs of beneficiaries.

This roundtable continues the theme of “Protecting the Patient – The Role of Cybersecurity.” Senior Government leaders from DOD, VA, and USCG, along with other federal partners including the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, will discuss EHR modernization efforts and highlight current and upcoming initiatives. In addition, there will be a panel discussion on the impact of the President’s Executive Order on “Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity” on the federal EHR and the patient.

This event will be virtual via Microsoft TEAMS and is open to the public. We invite active participation from individuals who possess relevant broad-based knowledge and experience. Additional details regarding the agenda and meeting will be distributed to registered participants as they are finalized prior to the event.
