# FEHRM Industry Roundtable

On May 18, 2022, the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office hosted the 12th FEHRM Industry Roundtable. Twice a year, the FEHRM hosts a government and industry roundtable to discuss the current and future state of health information technology and health information exchange. The roundtable also highlights the importance of the FEHRM, Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) collaborating with external partners to ensure the single, common federal electronic health record (EHR) serves the unique needs of beneficiaries.

This roundtable continued the theme of “Protecting the Patient – The Role of Cybersecurity.” Senior government leaders from DOD, VA, and USCG, along with other federal partners including the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, discussed EHR modernization efforts and highlighted current and upcoming initiatives. In addition, a government senior leader panel explored the impact of the President’s Executive Order on “Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity” on the federal EHR and the patient.

This virtual event was available through Microsoft Teams and open to the public. The FEHRM invites active participation from individuals who possess relevant broad-based knowledge and experience.
