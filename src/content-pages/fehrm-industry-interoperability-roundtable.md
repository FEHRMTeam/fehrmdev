# FEHRM Industry Roundtable

The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office hosts the Industry Roundtable semi-annually to provide a forum for discussion on the current and future state of health information technology (IT) and health information exchange. The roundtable features senior leaders from the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), along with other federal partners, including the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and subject matter experts from the private sector, who participate in panel discussions and provide updates. The purpose of the roundtable is for participants to share interoperability initiatives, challenges and successes.

The **11th FEHRM Industry Roundtable**, which took place Thursday, November 18, 2021, explored the theme, ***Protecting the Patient – The Role of Cybersecurity***. Senior Government leaders from DOD, VA, USCG, ONC and CMS discussed electronic health record (EHR) modernization efforts and highlighted current and upcoming initiatives. In addition, a panel discussion examined the impact of Presidential Executive Order 14028 — Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity — and the implementation of zero trust architecture on the federal EHR and, subsequently, the patient.

This roundtable was held virtually and open to the public. Nearly 200 federal and industry personnel, representing 74 industries and 20 federal organizations, attended the event.

The next FEHRM Industry Roundtable is scheduled for May 2022. Check back on this page for further details and updates about this upcoming event.
