# FEHRM Industry Roundtable – November 16, 2022

On November 16, 2022, the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office will host the 13th FEHRM Industry Roundtable. Twice a year, the FEHRM hosts a government and industry roundtable to discuss the current and future state of health information technology and health information exchange. The roundtable also highlights the importance of the FEHRM, Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) collaborating with external partners to ensure the single, common federal electronic health record (EHR) serves the unique needs of beneficiaries.

The Roundtable theme is “Change Management - Engaging Stakeholders in Electronic Health Record Modernization.” The Roundtable will feature a panel of senior government leaders from DOD, VA and USCG, along with other federal partners including the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, discussing EHR modernization efforts and highlighting current and upcoming initiatives. In addition, a technical panel of government and industry experts will explore the importance of Change Management in the EHR modernization effort.

This virtual event is available through Microsoft Teams and open to the public. The FEHRM invites active participation from individuals who possess relevant broad-based knowledge and experience.
