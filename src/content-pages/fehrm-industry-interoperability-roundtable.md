# FEHRM Industry Interoperability Roundtable

The FEHRM hosts the Industry Interoperability Roundtable semi-annually to provide a forum for discussion on the current and future state of health information technology (IT) and health information exchange. The roundtable features senior leaders from DOD, VA and USCG, along with other federal partners, including the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and subject matter experts from the private sector, who participate in panel discussions and provide updates. The purpose of the roundtable is for participants to share interoperability initiatives, challenges, and successes.

The latest FEHRM Industry Interoperability Roundtable was hosted on May 19, 2021 and featured panel discussions on Government Transformation and Leveraging Health IT during the COVID-19 pandemic. Check back for more details on future sessions.
