# Join the Joint HIE

While the federal electronic health record (EHR) is the federal source for your patient’s health history, the joint health information exchange (HIE) links federal EHR information with EHR information from participating community providers. Community providers include single-physician offices to multi-hospital systems outside of the federal health care systems (for example, DOD, VA and USCG) that may provide care to your patients.

The joint HIE is an enhanced network of community providers across the United States who agree to securely share clinical information with DOD, VA and USCG providers. The joint HIE enhances the ability of DOD, VA and USCG providers to quickly and securely access patient electronic health information from community providers and vice versa. Through the joint HIE, providers can access patient’s prescriptions, allergies, illnesses, lab and radiology results, immunizations, past medical procedures and medical notes.

With the joint HIE, your have a more complete view of your medical history, including data from community providers, allowing you to make the most informed medical decisions. This data sharing helps drive enhanced health care quality, safety and satisfaction.

**DOD, VA or USCG Providers**

If you are a DOD, VA or USCG provider, you can access the joint HIE data through the Joint Longitudinal Viewer’s (JLV) community health widget. JLV is available to DOD and VA providers through existing electronic health systems as well as through the new single, common federal EHR. The viewer is also [accessible online](https://jlv.health.mil/JLV). Users of the federal EHR can also access private sector partner information via the Outside Records tool in the EHR. 

**Community Providers**

Community providers can learn more about how to join the joint HIE on the [VA.gov website](http://va.gov/VHIE/For_Providers.asp).
