    question: How do patients share their medical records with facilities outside of
      Department of Defense (DOD) or Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and
      vice versa?
    answer: The joint health information exchange (HIE) enables the Federal
      Electronic Health Record (EHR) to bidirectionally exchange clinical
      documents with the private sector. To confirm whether an HIE, hospital,
      clinic, or other facility is connected to the joint HIE, please visit the
      [Health.mil Joint HIE
      page](https://www.health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Technology/Joint-HIE).
      For additional assistance, DOD beneficiaries can contact the DOD Global
      Services Center Help Desk at 1(800)600-9332, and VA beneficiaries can
      contact the My VA Health Portal Help Desk at 1(888)444-MYVA. For more
      information about how providers who are not connected can join the joint
      HIE, visit the FEHRM's [Join the Joint HIE
      page](https://www.fehrm.gov/join-the-joint-hie/).

      beneficiaries can access their patient portal at <https://www.va.gov> or
      <https://patientportal.myhealth.va.gov>. For additional assistance, DOD

  - questionid: fMMmOXD-s_2gBLhM-CwDM
    question: How is a patient's medical record protected from modifications made by
      random medical staff members or other administrators?
    answer: Although the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM)
      office is unaware of specific VA or DOD policies governing appropriate and
      inappropriate modification to patient records, federally mandated
      documentation compliance is part of normal oversight by health information
      management teams. Additionally, authorship of patient note modifications
      within the Federal EHR are electronically authenticated and auditable.
      Contact VA's Electronic Health Record Modernization Integration Office at
      [EHRMCommunications@va.gov](mailto:EHRMCommunications@va.gov) or the DOD
      Program Executive Office, Defense Healthcare Management Systems'
