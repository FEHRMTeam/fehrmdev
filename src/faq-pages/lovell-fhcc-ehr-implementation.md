faqQuestions:
  - question: Who is involved with the deployment of the federal EHR at Lovell FHCC?
    answer: The deployment of the single, common federal EHR at Lovell FHCC is led by the FEHRM in collaboration with the DOD Healthcare Management Systems Modernization (DHMSM) Program Management Office, VA’s Electronic Health Record Modernization Integration Office and Lovell FHCC stakeholders. The resulting EHR will be a true federal EHR, not a DOD system nor a VA system.
  - question: What is the timeline for federal EHR deployment at Lovell FHCC? Where are things now and what’s next?
    answer: The deployment of the federal EHR at Lovell FHCC was previously scheduled asynchronously, meaning DOD and VA users would go live with the EHR at different times. The asynchronous deployment approach posed a high risk of disrupting the integrated operations at Lovell FHCC. Potential risks included severely impairing existing shared services, jeopardizing patient safety and increasing costs to the Departments for delivery of care.<br /><br />In November 2019, at Lovell FHCC’s request, the FEHRM committed to a joint site engagement to assess the risk. In September 2020, the FEHRM, with various DOD, VA and vendor stakeholders, conducted a site engagement during which there was consensus for a synchronous deployment approach. By conducting a synchronous deployment, the Departments can realize cost-savings by reducing the duplicate work of two deployment efforts and mitigate the risks introduced through an asynchronous deployment at this fully integrated site. Through collaboration led by the FEHRM, the team agreed to use the DHMSM contract vehicle to deliver the federal EHR.<br /><br />The synchronous deployment of the federal EHR at Lovell FHCC is following a phased approach&#58;<ul><li><strong>Phase 0&#58;</strong> Planning</li><li><strong>Phase 1&#58;</strong> Assessment and Design Concept</li><li><strong>Phase 2&#58;</strong> Configure, Test</li><li><strong>Phase 3&#58;</strong> Deployment, Activation and Sustainment</li></ul>Currently in Phase 1, the multi-agency team completed a comprehensive end-to-end assessment at Lovell FHCC focused on gathering current state clinical and business process workflows. Now, the team is executing the Lovell FHCC Enterprise Requirements Adjudication (ERA) process. The ERA process is a thorough, high-impact decision-making process focused on DOD and VA requirements and deployment approach, where discrepancies exist. The ERA process deconflicts the build between DOD and VA, leverages existing governance boards and drives toward convergence. The ERA process is defining the design of the federal EHR for implementation at Lovell FHCC and the approach for the deployment.<br /><br />Outputs of the end-to-end assessment and the ERA process will inform the Lovell FHCC Implementation Plan, which will include milestones and timelines for the deployment. Once the Lovell FHCC Implementation Plan is finalized, the FEHRM will lead discussions between senior Department leadership to assess the projected Lovell FHCC go-live timing with DOD wave and VA VISN deployment timelines.
  - question: Will providers have to check two different areas for medication reconciliation?
    answer: No, there is a single location for medication reconciliation.
  - question: What is different about what the Lovell FHCC is deploying versus other DOD/VA sites?
    answer: Lovell FHCC is receiving the same federal electronic health record (EHR) as other Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Veterans (VA) sites. Lovell FHCC is using what DOD and VA already have. DOD and VA are given a certain amount of flexibility to configure the federal EHR differently to meet specific facilities’needs while still maintaining interoperability between the Departments. Any Departments using the EHR have access to these changes as well as other capabilities their specific facilities may need (that they may choose to turn on or off,as allowed). Patient care location (PCL) hierarchies is one example where Lovell FHCC requires a unique approach as a result of being a fully integrated, joint sharing site.<br /><br />PCL hierarchies correspond to physical locations of patients receiving health care services, with facilities at the top level of the hierarchy followed by buildings, nursing units, rooms and beds. Lovell FHCC will use two PCL hierarchies—one for each Department, in their respective facilities. All other DOD and VA facilities currently use either a DOD or VA PCL (not both) when they implement the federal EHR. Because patient care locations are associated with either DOD or VA locations at Lovell FHCC, they can be leveraged as the basis for user role assignment, workflow (1DOD or 1VA), interface, configuration and end-user training. Using both DOD and VA PCL hierarchies at Lovell FHCC allows each Department the ability to satisfy their respective statutory requirements regarding eligible beneficiaries and encounter charging.<br /><br />While a single PCL is the preferred option, existing legal and business barriers presented the need for a near-term solution to avoid significant schedule risks for the Lovell FHCC federal EHR implementation. Ultimately, DOD and VA can use this dual PCL configuration to provide Lovell FHCC with the existing DOD and VA enterprise configurations, without having to maintain a “Lovell FHCC specific” configuration. Further, orders portability is maintained, as orders can be associated (or “flexed”) to the correct PCL and service resource location within the federal EHR.
  - question: How will the patient portals work compared to other DOD and VA sites? Specifically, what will the experience be like for dual eligible patients?
    answer: Lovell FHCC will use both Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patient portals. DOD beneficiaries will use the DOD patient portal, VA beneficiaries will use the VA patient portal. Dual eligible patients can use either portal. There are some differences between how each portal is set up, most notably&#58;<ul><li>VA uses relationship-based scheduling, meaning only providers with an established relationship will appear to the patient for messaging and scheduling. DOD is moving to relationship-based scheduling; however, beneficiaries can direct book an appointment, which is not currently a feature enabled for VA.</li><li>VA can request prescription renewals from their care team and medication refills from pharmacies. DOD can request prescription renewals; however, medication refills is not enabled. DOD and VA beneficiaries can view and download Pathology and Radiology reports. Additionally, VA beneficiaries can view and download Microbiology and Cardiology reports.</li></ul>The process to login to the patient portal also differs by Department.<ul><li>There are two ways to access the <a href="https://health.mil/news/in-the-spotlight/mhs-genesis">MHS GENESIS Patient Portal</a>&#58; 1. Using a Common Access Card reader, or 2. Creating a DS Logon account.</li><li>A direct link to VA’s patient portal is sent to Veterans. The portal is accessible through <a href="https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/home">MyHealtheVet</a> and <a href="https://www.va.gov/">VA.gov</a>.</li></ul>As both DOD and VA use DS Logon to access their portals, it is important for beneficiaries to make sure their personal information (name, address, email and phone numbers) are listed correctly in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility ReportingSystem (DEERS) to avoid problems with claims, referrals, delivery of home prescriptions and access to care for dependents. Veterans and family members who receive health care or direct benefit payments from VA and changed their legal names since discharging from military service must update their new name with DEERS.
  - question: If the VA is pausing their deployments at VA medical facilities, why is Lovell FHCC deployment proceeding?
    answer: The Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are committed to deploying the single, common federal electronic health record (EHR) synchronously at Lovell FHCC in March 2024. Lovell FHCC is the only exception to the full-stop of VA deployment activities. VA is pivoting resources to ensure the Lovell FHCC deployment is a success. Since Lovell FHCC is a jointly run DOD and VA facility, the deployment will continue as planned to ensure that all beneficiaries who visit the facility are covered by one federal EHR. To ensure success, Lovell FHCC will continueto benefit from a multi-agency team of FEHRM, DOD and VA leaders who are working together to address and mitigate identified risks and implement lessons learned and best practices from other sites.<br /><br />Lovell FHCC federal EHR implementation is fundamental to interoperability and the federal EHR moving forward. The FEHRM, DOD and VA are committed to getting it right. By ensuring the Departments can work together as a single unit, Lovell FHCC becomes a model for how we can do this across DOD, VA and the broader federal enterprise to ensure seamless, integrated care for patients. It will help simplify our ability to work together and how the Departments can demonstrate interoperability.
  - question: Are there concerns about patient safety, given the experiences other VA medical facilities have had?
    answer: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) goal for the federal electronic health record (EHR) is, and always has been, to provide improved health outcomes for Veterans and a better experience for providers. VA acknowledges thatt here have been challenges with their efforts to date. VA will be working closely with Oracle Cerner to resolve outstanding performance, reliability and patient safety concerns, prior to the March 2024 deployment at Lovell FHCC.<br /><br />As with any site, the Lovell FHCC federal EHR deployment includes a 12-month cadence of deployment events to prepare the facility’s technology, processes and people for the change in systems. As a result of the enterprise nature of the federal EHR, VA and Oracle Cerner can address the four patient safety issues identified in their Sprint Report (i.e., unknown queue, no show/cancelled appointment routing toscheduling queues, creation of visible external referrals for worklist action and ordering procedure charge codes without ordering the actual clinical imaging) ahead of Lovell FHCC’s go-live.<br /><br />It’s also worth noting the federal EHR exceeds industry standards for protecting patient information, satisfying DOD standards for cybersecurity and DOD and VA agreed-to standards of privacy.
  - question: How will deploying the federal EHR at Lovell FHCC lead the way for other health care systems?
    answer: Lovell FHCC is a perfect example of true jointness. The deployment of the federal electronic health record (EHR) at Lovell FHCC will lead the way for how two large health care systems work together to make the best care decisions without technology being a barrier. The FEHRM will converge configurations, where appropriate, to integrate processes and harmonize workflows between Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as part of deploying the federal EHR at Lovell FHCC. By ensuring the Departments can work together as a single unit, Lovell FHCC becomes a model for how we can do this across DOD, VA and the broader federal enterprise to ensure seamless care for patients. It will help simplify our ability to work together and how the Departments can be engaged with each other. This work will evolve the federal EHR baseline to better serve providers and patients across the federal government. Ultimately, Lovell FHCC will serve as a prototype for how different health care systems can work together in new ways to deliver care to their patients.
  - question: What are the benefits of the Lovell FHCC federal EHR implementation?
    answer: Implementation of the federal electronic health record (EHR) at Lovell FHCC benefits providers, patients and the broader health care enterprise in the following ways&#58;<ul><li>Enhances the federal EHR baseline to better serve patients and providers across the federal government</li><li>Converges configurations, workflows, terminology and content, where appropriate, between the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to improve clinical decision-making</li><li>Documents lessons learned and provides a roadmap for future federal EHR deployments and troubleshooting, especially at joint sharing sites where care is integrated</li><li>Standardizes user roles, forms and configuration variations between DOD and VA, where appropriate</li><li>Models how large health care systems can leverage technology to drive the best health care decisions</li><li>Allows for the test and evaluation of meaningful exchange and use of data between DOD, VA and other health care systems, as required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020</li></ul>Ultimately, Lovell FHCC leads the way for future federal EHR deployments and improving patient care and the end-user experience.
