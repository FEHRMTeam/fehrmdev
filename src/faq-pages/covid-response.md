  - question: How has the data gained from the federal electronic health record and
      joint health information exchange been used to enhance health care? How
      did it help in 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis?
    answer: >
      The federal electronic health record (EHR), along with the joint health
      information exchange (HIE), is empowering health care administrators and
      providers with more data. The data we gain from the federal EHR and joint
      HIE helps enable more standard workflows and practices to enhance clinical
      decision-making and health care. It also helps drive business decisions,
      inform population health initiatives and improve patient outcomes through
      innovations.


      For example, the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) joint data management and analysis efforts led to our ability to improve the process for prescribing opioids. Patients at risk of an opioid overdose who receive opioid pain medication will also receive a life-saving drug that counteracts the opioid prescribed along with education.


      Another example of effective HIE, is our integration of an Immunization Forecaster into the EHR. The forecaster embedded into the EHR leverages Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clinical decision support of immunizations to help pediatricians know when patients need the next round of appropriate vaccines. This new functionality also reduces clinician time and effort, assessing and deciding which vaccines may be due. Even if a child falls behind, it recommends a catch-up schedule. This effort is especially timely with regard to the forthcoming COVID-19 vaccine.


      DOD is also looking into developing a trauma registry to capture battlefield injuries and the impact of such injuries throughout a beneficiary’s lifetime.


      The EHR and subsequent data we now have available help make all these innovations in health care possible so beneficiaries can get the best health care as soon as possible. We are just scratching the surface on what is possible with EHR data to transform health care delivery to Veterans.

  - question: Has COVID-19 impacted the Federal Electronic Health Record
      Modernization office's activities and the future of electronic health
      record modernization?
    answer: >
      The Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
      did disengage with providers at the start of COVID-19, so the providers
      could focus on responding to the national pandemic. In the meantime, the
      Departments re-planned continuously, seeking ways to enhance capabilities
      and gain efficiencies, so they were ready to respond once the providers
      could focus on electronic health record (EHR) deployments again. For
      example, the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Coast Guard (USCG)
      shifted to an entire virtual training model that DOD and VA are learning
      from and incorporating into their training techniques.


      COVID-19 has demonstrated the ability of the single, common federal EHR to quickly adapt to changing demands and support providers during the pandemic. For example, when providers needed to order COVID-19 tests, and the EHR didn’t yet have that capability, we were able to make those changes in four hours within the new EHR versus four weeks within the legacy system. The new EHR is much more responsive to changes driven by COVID-19.


      So, we have not slowed down our progress with EHR modernization during the pandemic. We remain focused on delivering capabilities to those we serve: clinicians on the front lines delivering care and their patients.


      As for how it has impacted the future of EHR modernization, COVID-19 demonstrated virtual health as a priority. In response, the FEHRM pivoted toward accelerating the adoption of tools, platforms and joint capabilities to deliver telemedicine solutions that meet the operational requirements driven by the pandemic. For example, the FEHRM is leveraging VA’s patient-facing video platform to develop a parallel platform for DOD.


      Moving forward, there are many opportunities to understand and think about the impact of the new normal of health care delivery and how the EHR and information technology capabilities the FEHRM delivers can support the new normal.
