  - question: What are joint sharing sites?
    answer: >
      Department of Defense (DOD)/Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) sharing
      sites, also known as joint sharing sites, are medical facilities where DOD
      and VA collaborate to support health care delivery to Veterans, Service
      members, and their beneficiaries. DOD and VA medical sharing varies
      significantly from facility to facility—from providers, clinical,
      janitorial, and administrative staff to physical space, processes, and
      technologies.


      The least integrated joint sharing sites may only share custodial services or coordinate purchases of supplies, while more tightly integrated joint sharing sites embed providers in the other Department’s space, coordinate care and treatment options, and access the other Department’s electronic health record (EHR) to document care and submit clinical orders (until the Departments are using the same single, common Federal EHR). The most highly integrated joint sharing site is the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center in North Chicago, Illinois.

  - question: >
      What are the benefits of the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of
      Veterans Affairs (VA) medical sharing?
    answer: >
      By leveraging the existing services of both DOD and VA facilities, a joint
      sharing site can take advantage of economies of scale and offer a broader
      range of services to both DOD and VA patient populations in their
      catchment area. In some cases, a joint sharing site also expands the
      access to care options a patient may have available by providing multiple
      locations to receive the same type of care.


      Joint sharing sites are also a net benefit to DOD and VA clinical staff in locations where the increased patient acuity and volume supports training and readiness objectives.

  - question: >
      How many joint sharing sites exist between the Department of Defense (DOD)
      and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)?
    answer: >
      As of July 2022, there are 159 facilities (85 DOD and 74 VA) that have
      active resource-sharing agreements nationwide. The number of active
      resource-sharing agreements changes monthly based on the clinical needs of
      the sites, availability of personnel to support those agreements, and
      whether agreements are activated, de-activated, or renewed.

  - question: >
      Why are joint sharing sites a unique challenge due to the asynchronous
      deployment of the Federal Electronic Health Record (EHR) across both
      Departments?
    answer: >
      Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs Federal EHR
      deployment timelines are not always synchronized for joint sharing sites.
      Consequently, the asynchronous nature of the deployments may result in
      some level of risk and impact to required workflows and service offerings
      that are managed by the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization
      (FEHRM) office to ensure continued health care. The FEHRM’s focus is on
      the gap created by the asynchronous deployment.

  - question: >
      What does the Federal Electronic Health Record (EHR) deployment process
      look like for joint sharing sites?
    answer: >
      The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office views
      asynchronous deployment of the Federal EHR as occurring through sequential
      phases. In most instances, the Department of Defense (DOD) will deploy
      ahead of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The first DOD deployment
      will bring the joint sharing site to an interim state, or transition
      state, in which DOD is on the Federal EHR and VA is on the legacy EHR. The
      joint sharing site is at its end state when DOD and VA are on the same
      Federal EHR.

  - question: >
      What are the lessons learned from previous Federal Electronic Health
      Record (EHR) deployments at joint sharing sites?
    answer: >+
      There have been multiple successful Department of Defense (DOD) EHR
      deployments at joint sharing sites to date. The first Department of
      Veterans Affairs (VA) deployment at a joint sharing site occurred in March
      2024. The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office,
      DOD, and VA continue to refine their approach to address lessons learned,
      including the following:


      - Early identification of VA users at joint sharing sites impacted by DOD deployment who will require access to the Federal EHR prior to VA deployment

      - Development and application of new-user provisioning scenarios to be leveraged by the program management offices, based on standard business rules

      - Development and deployment of Federal EHR access tip sheets to support end users

      - Development of interim-state process maps to ensure the continuity of shared clinical services through the transition state

      - Analysis and adjudication of the differences between DOD and VA roles (e.g., DOD/VA Surgeons and Intensive Care Unit Nurses)
