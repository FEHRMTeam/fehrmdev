  - question: Will the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization office
      collaborate with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health
      Information Technology and standards development organizations?
    answer: Yes, the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization office engages
      with federal and national standards organizations, including the Office of
      the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, and private
      sector partners to advance interoperability standards that enable the
      exchange of information across all sectors of the industry and government,
      a key driver to effective transformation. This effort improves the
      continuity of care among and between public and private sector providers.

  - question: What are the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization office’s
      top priorities for the next year?
    answer: >
      Some of our top priorities include operationalizing the Federal Electronic
      Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office and focusing on convergence.


      We are operationalizing the FEHRM by evolving the FEHRM to become the single provider of the federal electronic health record (EHR), providing a common set of capabilities across the health care industry.


      We focus on convergence by figuring out how to converge EHR workflows and configurations to streamline the patient experience. While the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have unique clinical and business issues that differ based on their missions, the FEHRM is focused on converging DOD, VA, USCG and NOAA clinical and business capabilities where appropriate. The FEHRM overseas configuration and content changes to the federal EHR that are agreed on by the Departments through a joint decision-making process facilitated by the FEHRM. The goal is that DOD, VA, USCG and NOAA providers in the same roles will have a common user experience with the federal EHR defined by evidence-based best practice. Providers won't need to relearn things depending on where they provide care. From the patient perspective, this means health care will be delivered the same way regardless of where they get care. They have a consistent patient care experience. Convergence ultimately helps us enable more standard workflows and practices to enhance clinical decision-making and health care. Workflows are the series of tasks required to complete a health care function (for example, ordering a medication). Standard workflows are considered best practices because they guidance compliance with clinical best care guidelines. Convergence helps us determine the best workflow solutions that are safe, effective and efficient.


      We are also prioritizing joint sharing sites, which are sites where DOD and VA resources (like staff and facilities) are shared. Leading the deployment of the EHR joint sharing sites, the FEHRM has the potential to enable the DOD and VA health care systems to work together in new ways to deliver health care to Service members, Veterans and their families.


      We are also focusing on bringing additional federal agencies to the federal EHR and determining what that looks like.

  - question: What are some of the lessons learned to date with the federal
      electronic health record?
    answer: >
      At the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization office, we are
      capturing and sharing lessons learned and best practices as we work in a
      common environment and deploy the federal electronic health record.


      We’ve learned that the technology works. So, it’s really about change management—the processes, people, culture, training and communications that need to be in place to be successful. The infrastructure also cannot be antiquated. It must be able to support the newer technologies.


      We adapted to the current pandemic environment and used it as a catalyst: How can we do things better, smarter and take advantage of tools at our disposal now?


      It takes the right people, and the right people are coming together every day. It takes a team. No individual or organization possesses all the expertise to make this a reality. We will continue to build on the team.

  - question: Looking to the future, what does the Federal Electronic Health Record
      Modernization office see as a vision for using information technology to
      improve health care services?
    answer: >
      The efforts and successes with the federal electronic health record (EHR)
      and with our partners are only the beginning. We are just scratching the
      surface on what is possible with EHR, joint health information exchange
      (HIE) and other health information technology capabilities to transform
      health care delivery.


      Partnerships between the federal government, community providers and commercial vendors will continue to be critical. These partnerships will drive integration, interoperability and the best possible health care for all patients regardless of where they receive care and who provides it.


      The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization office's vision is that we take technology out of the equation, so providers and administrators can make the best decisions together on care delivery. We want to remove technology as a barrier. It’s about getting the right data to the right person at the right time to make informed health care decisions.


      We are energized and excited to continue to work with our federal, community and industry partners to improve health care for all our beneficiaries. The possibilities are limitless now that we have a foundation in place.

  - question: How can industry support the Federal Electronic Health Record
      Modernization office?
    answer: >
      We continue to look to industry for partnerships, for relationships that
      can help us shape our path moving forward. We highly value the innovative
      ideas vendors bring to the table, and we rely on those steadfast
      partnerships, such as those with the Leidos Partnership for Defense Health
      for the Department of Defense and that we see between the Department of
      Veterans Affairs and Oracle Cerner.


      There are a lot of other relationships and partnerships being developed as we look toward new technologies and available capabilities.


      In navigating the future, we look for innovative ideas for improving the patient experience and enhancing the quality of care delivery during this time. For example, how do we implement the EHR and train end users with the social distancing precautions in place during the pandemic? Or, how do we deliver technology at the frontlines of care—whether it’s in theater, in rural America or while a patient is being transported?


      Also, the federal electronic health record and joint health information exchange means our providers now have access to more information about their patients than ever before to make the best care decisions. We need to make sure this data is usable and built into provider workflows. We need vendor engagement as we do this.


      When we are all focused on delivering high-quality care seamlessly as patients move from one delivery system to another, innovation, integrating new capabilities through expanded partnerships and collaboration will move us ahead.
