  - question: >
      What is the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (Lovell
      FHCC)?
    answer: >
      Lovell FHCC is a first-of-its-kind partnership between the Department of
      Defense (DOD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It’s a fully
      integrated federal health care center that serves both DOD and VA patient
      populations. Located in North Chicago, Illinois, Lovell FHCC was
      established in October 2010 to provide health care to Service members,
      Veterans, and other beneficiaries.


      Lovell FHCC shares medical and non-medical services and operates via fully integrated DOD/VA medical personnel and leadership team. Now known as legacy interoperability capabilities, DOD and VA implemented functionalities enabling joint patient registration and orders portability for laboratory results and consultations; one medical staff with single departments; single systems such as human resources, finance, performance measures, workload, and personnel; and one local budget.


      Lovell FHCC provides eligible beneficiaries with a single check-in process and standardized patient care. Lovell FHCC provides a full spectrum of health care for patients, including full medical and surgical care, a large array of medical sub-specialties, a variety of mental health services, a Community Living Center, and many other programs.


      Lovell FHCC’s information technology and information management teams safely interface DOD and VA health information technology systems to support an integrated facility.

  - question: >
      What’s the history behind the development of the Captain James A. Lovell
      Health Care Center (Lovell FHCC)?
    answer: >
      In May 2005, the Department of Defense (DOD)/Department of Veterans
      Affairs (VA) Health Executive Council signed an agreement to integrate the
      North Chicago VA Medical Center and the Naval Health Clinic Great Lakes,
      establishing Lovell FHCC. The two facilities merged and became Lovell FHCC
      in October 2010. In 2014, the Defense Medical Information Exchange Program
      Management Office and VA Office of Information and Technology assumed
      Lovell FHCC management roles and responsibilities. In March 2016, DOD and
      VA recommended, and Congress concurred with, the continuation of Lovell
      FHCC as a demonstration of an integrated facility, focusing on
      implementation and improvements.

      Veterans Affairs (VA) medical and dental care, while continuing to meet

      treatment facility; and to the Lovell FHCC Advisory Board, DOD/VA Health
      Executive Committee, and Joint Executive Committee.
