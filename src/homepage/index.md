  taglineDescription: <p> The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization
    (FEHRM) office works within the federal space to implement a single, common
    federal electronic health record (EHR) that enhances patient care and
    provider effectiveness. An EHR is software that's used to securely document,
    store, retrieve, share and analyze information about individual patient
    care. It enables a digital version of a patient record. <p>The FEHRM <a
    href="/about-fehrm">unites efforts and delivers common capabilities</a> that
    enable the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA),
    Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and other federal
    agencies to deploy the same federal EHR. Common capabilities refer to common
    solutions, tools and activities needed to effectively implement the federal
    EHR and ensure meaningful data sharing between the federal EHR and community
    providers. </p> <p> The federal EHR helps health care systems within the
    federal space and beyond effectively deliver health care and benefits by
    bringing a common record to patients and providers. There is <a
    href="/success-stories"> recognition across the board </a> that the federal
    EHR saves providers time and enables more standard workflows to support
    enhanced clinical decision-making and patient safety.</p> <p>As of today,
    there are more than 124,000 DOD, VA and USCG federal EHR users—such as
    doctors and nurses—at 74 DOD Commands, five VA Medical Centers and 109 USCG
    sites. More than 5.1 million unique patients are in the federal EHR
    system.</p>
