            answer: >
              Yes, there is a plan to revisit early DOD sites to update the
              build to the enterprise standards. For additional information, please email [federalehrannualsummit@va.gov](mailto:federalehrannualsummit@va.gov).
            question: >
              How were the Defense Health Agency enterprise standards
              determined? Is there a plan to revisit early Department of Defense
              (DOD) deployment sites to update the build to the established
              enterprise standards?
          - question: >
              In addition to setting up Informatics Steering Committees and
              preemptively laying the groundwork for change management, what other concrete recommendations are
              available for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) sites going live in fiscal
              year 2026 and beyond?
            answer: >
              VA sites going live with the new Federal Electronic Health Record
              (EHR) in 2026 and beyond should establish a strong change management plan early, ensuring
              leadership engagement and clear communication with staff. Comprehensive end-user training must be prioritized, including real-world workflows to build
              confidence before go-live. Dedicated super users—end users with more training
              in and experience with the Federal EHR—should be identified to provide on-the-ground support, troubleshoot issues, and reinforce best practices. After go-live,
              continuous feedback loops and performance monitoring will be essential for
              driving system optimization and ensuring user adoption.

            question: >
              What is a super user, and what additional training is required to
              become one? The perception is that super users receive more in-depth training than regular
              users, enabling them to gain a deeper understanding and hands-on experience
              with the system.
            answer: >
              Super users get more detailed training in the Federal Electronic Health Record (EHR) and,
              over time, gain considerable experience in the Federal EHR. A key characteristic of Super users
              is that they serve as an ongoing resource for their colleagues and remain
              accessible to address operational questions by providing best-practice guidance
              on how to use the Federal EHR.

            question: >
              At the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (Lovell FHCC), is there a plan in place to retire the Joint Longitudinal Viewer (JLV) once backlog data migrates from Computerized Patient Record Systems (CPRS) and Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) into the Federal Electronic Health Record (EHR), or is there an alternate strategy to keep JLV as is?
            answer: >
              Currently, CPRS and AHLTA DOD legacy clinical data sites are in the Military Health System Information Platform. The front-facing applications are JLV and the Health Information Archive, which are currently being built out. There are no immediate plans set to phase out JLV.

              What is the average turnaround time of a change request?
            answer: >
              Currently, one to two weeks is the average cycle time. Change requests that are ready for the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office’s Joint Sustainment and Adoption Board (JSaAB) must be ready by the 1 p.m. ET, Monday, deadline. Once approved by JSaAB on Wednesday, a release date is set for the following Tuesday or Thursday (Oracle Health release days). If review by the FEHRM’s Federal Change Control Board (FCCB) is necessary, there will be a two-week lag until the change request is approved by the FCCB.

            question: >
              Users in the Disease Management Department report having to chart
              under the Case Management role. This causes confusion among staff
              and patients as these users feel that there are too many ways to
              complete a single task. What insights can assist Disease
              Management Department users in streamlining their workflow within
              the system?
            answer: >
              The Department of Defense (DOD) is working on a Disease Management
              workflow MPage within PowerForms. Generally, during the
              development of all workflow-related activities, DOD and the
              Department of Veterans Affairs look to converge
              whenever possible to achieve enhanced patient outcomes.

              What is the status of including the keyword search function within the Documentation tab? End users who attended previous annual summits were informed that this functionality was being worked on; however, end users do not have visibility into the status of this fix.
            answer: >
              That work is continuing. The Federal Ambulatory Working Group has deliberated on several interim ideas for optimizing functionality and improving workflow in the Federal Electronic Health Record. While this is one of them, it is prioritized against other urgent demands.

            question: >
              Reviewing the patients' medication profiles is cumbersome, with a lot of time spent going into the Joint Longitudinal Viewer (JLV) to investigate appropriately. Will anything be implemented to streamline this pertinent workflow step?
            answer: >
              Yes, the implementation of 3b functionality as part of Capability Block 12 for both the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), along with additional functionality already implemented during 2024 (e.g., the date of last fill/refill and a more accurate mediation list in PowerChart as a result of making the Stop Date field optional for both agencies), ensures that the medication list in PowerChart for all users is reflective of all medications that a patient is receiving. Prescriptions that a patient receives by mail order from Express Scripts are the only exception; those items remain only visible in JLV without proper addition of those “home medications” to the patient's medication list via the medication reconciliation process. The implementation of Seamless Exchange functionality within the Federal Electronic Health Record for medications will also dramatically improve the end user’s ability to conduct medication reconciliation with information received from outside partners. Initial implementation is underway at limited VA sites with planned implementation at Defense Health Agency sites as well. Bottom line: Proper medication reconciliation should always be performed for each provider visit.

            question: >
              Can functionality be created to review the refill history?
            answer: >
              That functionality currently exists. Within Medication Manager Retail, a history action will allow the end user to review dispense history (also known as refill history). Within PowerChart, the end user now sees the Last Filled date displayed, when selecting the patient’s Medication List, within the Details tab. The end user can also right-click on the order and select Order Information, then the History tab, and then Dispense History to view complete refill information.

            question: >
              When viewing the clinical schedule, can users filter out canceled
              appointments to view only existing appointments in the printed view?
            answer: >
              End users can filter out cancelled appointments in the Federal
              Electronic Health Record by doing the following: Open the
              appointment book. Under the View or Filter
              setting, use filter options to exclude cancelled appointments. Select the desired
              statuses, such as Scheduled or Confirmed, and deselect Cancelled. Once the
              filters are set, proceed to print the schedule. This should exclude the
              cancelled appointments from the printout.

              Currently, Ambulatory Care notes are being used by other departments (e.g., Mental Health), causing some confusion to other department users. Are there department-specific note templates available or planned?
            answer: >
              In the Federal Electronic Health Record, the Ambulatory Care notes functionality is used by multiple services and departments. Examples include Primary Care and Specialty Clinics, such as Cardiology, Endocrinology, Mental Health, and Pediatrics. These departments, along with other outpatient clinics not listed, use Ambulatory Care notes to document patient encounters, treatment plans, and follow-up care in outpatient settings.

              Will Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes be required by
              both the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Veterans
              Affairs (VA) clinical schedulers? If not, please provide insight
              as to why CPT codes are required by VA only.
            answer: >
              Currently, CPT codes are not required by either DOD or VA clinical
              schedulers.

            question: >
              Should surgical history be based on the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses codes, which are more general but help the operating room (OR) team with consumables, etc., or on Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, which are more specific to what was done in the OR? 
            answer: > 
              The surgical history should be based on how the coders finalize the CPT codes.

              What is the status of providing New Order alerts on tracking boards for ancillary services, such as labs or radiology?
            answer: >
              It depends on whether the tracking board is used in the perioperative vice emergency department setting. In perioperative tracking boards, a New Order column was attempted but not well received.

            question: >
              Are there any plans to leverage Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and move away from Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) codes for operating room (OR) applications in the Federal Electronic Health Record? OR teams note that AORN codes are nonspecific and can be problematic in capturing patient history and accurate OR time estimates.
            answer: >
              Due to the excessive number of CPT codes (more than 10,000), the number of preference cards per site is not sustainable; therefore, end users should default to AORN for now.

              Are there any plans to have specialty considered in Federal Electronic Health Record (EHR) preference cards to reflect specific Association of periOperative Registered Nurses procedures?
            answer: >
              The new Federal EHR preference card selection is not based on the specialty of the surgeon and, therefore, is not configurable. The recommendation is to create surgeon-specific preference cards.

              How are notes for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medications, entered in Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture, reflected in the Federal Electronic Health Record (e.g., direct oral anticoagulant, antiplatelet, or sildenafil notes)?
            answer: >
              Any note creation or other documentation requirements are built into alerts and/or prior authorization medication formulary requirements on both Department of Defense and VA sides. Both Departments leverage system alerts, or Prior Authorization and Medical Necessity requirements, for formulary restrictions and documentation requirements.

              How can people review expired medications? There is no way to locate prescriptions that have been picked up, regardless of the filter.
            answer: >   
              After the implementation of 3b, as part of the release of Capability Block 12, the Department of Defense adopted the current Department of Veterans Affairs functionality, which makes the Stop Date field optional. Prescriptions that reached the Legal Stop Date will still display as active/prescribed in the patient's medication list, and a provider/pharmacist must take an action to discontinue it from the active medication list—which is often completed by renewing the medication order, since the order that reached the Legal Stop Date is no longer actionable. The resulting medication list is more accurate, and the user does not need to adjust filters to see discontinued orders for these cases. Future impact of Seamless Exchange functionality as it applies to patients’ medication lists will also change how end users will be able to view expired medications, but continued use of filters to display discontinued orders is currently still a recommended practice.

              Are there plans to align and standardize pharmacy policy, scope, and roles across the enterprise?
            answer: >
              Current clinical pharmacy roles—for both the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs—allow for PowerChart prescribing, similar to provider roles. Any additional certifications achieved by pharmacy staff through state certification still require obtaining credentials through the specific facility that employs that professional. Role assignment in the Federal Electronic Health Record is determined by the credentials assigned by the facility's Professional Affairs staff, within the confines of roles available for the Department. People can always request new roles via the Governance, Risk, and Compliance/ServiceNow ticketing process as well.

            question: >
              Pharmacists typically calculate medication supply based on maximum dosage. Are there plans to include “1 to 2 tablets” as a traditional codified dosage range that would calculate in the same way as “2 tablets” would in the Federal Electronic Health Record? 
            answer: >
              Anything beyond consecutive digits in the Quantity field is typically interpreted as free text, which results in the action no longer being codified during translation. This results in See Instructions with interoperable connection to PowerChart from the Medication Manager Retail (MMR) module, or subsequent renewal in MMR. A recent improvement, made after the implementation of Capability Block 12, addresses this question though. If the end user utilizes the standard codified sigs that include “Take 1 to 2 tablets” (i.e., short sig of “t1–2”), the Quantity Per Dose field is codified in MMR as 2 tablets, which also translates into the proper calculation of Days Supply. Educating end users in all aspects of 3b of Capability Block 12, including the new codified dosing fields, was part of Capability Block 12’s 3b implementation.

              Are there any plans to address the use of functionality within the Revenue Cycle application at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Patient Care Locations to select the proper insurance for patients seeking dental appointments? It is noted that not all Veterans have their VA Dental Veterans Health Administration Profile within the Federal Electronic Health Record (EHR).
            answer: >
              Proper insurance collection is a standard step in creating an encounter for services. The Federal EHR bases its processing on entering the proper insurance to achieve a billing claim. The absence of this data can result in costs to the Veteran. Procedures and protocols should be available to assist in identifying dental benefits for Veterans. If none exist, please contact Training and Development to assist. To continue the improvement of the Federal EHR, end users should identity gaps in the current approved workflow and recommend improvements or changes for consideration to their local informatics team.

            answer: >
              It is unusual for a late change to trigger a charge in the Revenue Cycle application. The first recommendation is that an informaticist with medical record configuration expertise review the back-end coding to understand the justification of the late change. Health Information Management always codes after services are rendered; this issue could grow into a problem for patient accounting. Additionally, request that the local manager receive a weekly status report on the progress of the configuration change.

              Are there any plans to modify or stop the scroll function that allows for the ability to change the medical service selected at check-in? End users report that, while Admin can catch errors, sometimes, on the General Ledger Default Audit Report, this functionality has led to the wrong medical service selection and requires manual updating downstream.
            answer: >
              A daily audit report to capture this system error would be beneficial prior to it surfacing within the general ledger. This could be caused by either a system glitch or an end-user error. A daily report should help to quickly identify errors due to the selection of the wrong medical service. Please submit a ticket for this issue.

              What are the planned guardrails for the Revenue Cycle application that will prevent provider templates from being applied under scheduled blocks? This creates a large administrative burden on commands and impacts metrics.
            answer: >  
              Templates are applied to resources. A schedule block can be applied over a resource schedule. This has value in that a schedule block could be removed, and an active template would be available to use for booking.

            question: >
              With respect to scheduling, what are the pros and cons of booking patients as walk-ins versus booking them into white space?
            answer: >  
              A walk-in is an appointment with an active encounter in real time. The appointment is booked, and the patient is checked in with an active encounter. Booking an appointment into white space is booking an appointment where there is no slot.

            question: >
              What is the status of the change request to update the Medication Reconciliation Report to track type of visit? End users report that the current report is inaccurate, as it counts nursing visits (e.g., allergy shots, blood pressure checks), giving a lower provider completion percentage. Also, the report can only be run by facility, not provider, making tracking floats difficult.
            answer: >
              Please submit or provide a ServiceNow ticket identifying the defective report name.

            question: >
              Are any plans underway to improve the Lights On Network (LON)? Specifically, end users wonder about improvements to Medication Manager Retail (MMR)/Pharmacy markers to enable the development of productivity reports that contain required data for assessment.
            answer: >
              Yes, improvements to productivity reports within LON are being completed on a rolling basis, with changes to reports being published through each Department’s weekly end-user engagement presentation. Exactly when each LON report will be improved is in the hands of the Oracle Health Team and/or Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Team assigned to the process. Currently, there are more than 800 Global Support Center/ServiceNow tickets pending related to improving reports. Pharmacy productivity reporting concerns are high on the list of improvements for both the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs; therefore, expect more in 2025.

              Will multicenter studies conducted at sites that are already using the Federal Electronic Health Record (EHR), such as clinical drug trials, be available to sites that are not yet using the Federal EHR?
            answer: >
              No, until those sites go live with the new Federal EHR, they will not have access to PowerTrials.
