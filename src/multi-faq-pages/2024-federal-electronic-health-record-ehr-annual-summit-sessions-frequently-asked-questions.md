              both the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Veterans
              Affairs (VA) clinical schedulers? If not, please provide insight
              as to why CPT codes are required by VA only.

            question: >
              Users in the Disease Management Department report having to chart
              under the Case Management role. This causes confusion among staff
              and patients as these users feel that there are too many ways to
              complete a single task. What insights can assist Disease
              Management Department users in streamlining their workflow within
              the system?
            answer: >
              The Department of Defense (DOD) is working on a Disease Management
              workflow MPage within PowerForms. Generally, during the
              development of all workflow-related activities, DOD and the
              Department of Veterans Affairs look to converge

              whenever possible to achieve enhanced patient outcomes.

            question: >
              When viewing the clinical schedule, can users filter out canceled
              appointments to

              view only existing appointments in the printed view?
            answer: >
              End users can filter out cancelled appointments in the Federal
              Electronic Health Record by doing the following: Open the
              appointment book. Under the View or Filter

              setting, use filter options to exclude cancelled appointments. Select the desired

              statuses, such as Scheduled or Confirmed, and deselect Cancelled. Once the

              filters are set, proceed to print the schedule. This should exclude the

              cancelled appointments from the printout.

            answer: >
              Yes, there is a plan to revisit early DOD sites to update the
              build to the

              enterprise standards. For additional information, please email [federalehrannualsummit@va.gov](mailto:federalehrannualsummit@va.gov).
            question: >
              How were the Defense Health Agency enterprise standards
              determined? Is there a plan to revisit early Department of Defense
              (DOD) deployment sites to update the build to the established
              enterprise standards?
          - question: >
              In addition to setting up Informatics Steering Committees and
              preemptively laying

              the groundwork for change management, what other concrete recommendations are

              available for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) sites going live in fiscal

              year 2026 and beyond?
            answer: >
              VA sites going live with the new Federal Electronic Health Record
              (EHR) in 2026

              and beyond should establish a strong change management plan early, ensuring

              leadership engagement and clear communication with staff. Comprehensive end-user training must be prioritized, including real-world workflows to build

              confidence before go-live. Dedicated super users—end users with more training

              in and experience with the Federal EHR—should be identified to provide on-the-ground support, troubleshoot issues, and reinforce best practices. After go-live,

              continuous feedback loops and performance monitoring will be essential for

              driving system optimization and ensuring user adoption.

            question: >
              What is a super user, and what additional training is required to
              become one? The

              perception is that super users receive more in-depth training than regular

              users, enabling them to gain a deeper understanding and hands-on experience

              with the system.
            answer: >
              Super users get more detailed training in the Federal EHR and,
              over time, gain

              considerable experience in the Federal EHR. A key characteristic of Super users

              is that they serve as an ongoing resource for their colleagues and remain

              accessible to address operational questions by providing best-practice guidance

              on how to use the Federal EHR.
